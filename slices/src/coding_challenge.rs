/*
Define a `cereals` array with 5 heap Strings
  - Cookie Crisp
  - Cinnamon Toast Crunch
  - Frosted Flakes
  - Cocoa Puffs
  - Captain Crunch

Declare a `first_two` variable that extracts a slice
of the first two cereals. Print the slice.

Declare a `mid_three` variable that extracts a slice
of the middle three cereals (Cinnamon Toast Crunch
up to and including Cocoa Puffs). Print the slice.

Declare a `last_three` variable that extracts a slice
of the last three cereals. Print the slice.

Using the `last_three` slice, target the last element
("Captain Crunch") and replace it with "Lucky Charms".
Print the complete `cereals` array.

Declare a `cookie_crisp` variable. Make it a reference
to the "Cookie Crisp" String (in other words, a &String).

Declare a `cookie` variable that extracts a slice of
the text "Cookie" from the String. Print the slice.

Declare a `cocoa_puffs` variable. Make it a reference
to the "Cocoa Puffs" String (in other words, a &String).

Declare a `puffs` variable that extracts a slice of
the text "Puffs" from the String. Print the slice.
